On Saturday, June 28, 2025 we got together for our fourth session.

## Skipping Ahead
Because this was Jeremy's final session, we skipped ahead, assuming that the party fought the goblins and ogres from their contract. Instead, we moved ahead to the party hunting down an unknown flying creature in the jungle.

## The Search in the Jungle
As the party searched the jungle, they encountered an area overgrown with thorns. As they traversed the area, they found that briar thickets had grown thicker and thicker, until the briar patch was taller than even Anak.

Instead of forge through the briars, the party turned aside, finding the edge of what they then realized was a rough circle, with the highest brambles right in the center. Naturally, and correctly, they assumed that the creature they were seeking was in the center of the bramble ring.

### Fighting the Thorn Dragon
After burning their way through the brambles, the party entered the lair of the Thorn Dragon. The dragon emerged from its hoard and attempted to destroy the party. The dragon's domain made the fight both difficult and frustrating, costing the party extra movement and damaging them every time they tried to take a step.

Ultimately, despite the dragon's best attempts, the party defeated it. When they looted the dragon's hoard they didn't find gold or other valuables. Instead, only piles of rotten food, natural materials, and a variety of other unweildy items.

## Returning to Shadowcrest Vale
The party returned to Shadowcrest Vale and reported their success. In return for their incredible string of contracts, the party was rewarded with all of the materials and knowledge required to craft a single item of their choice.

Additionally, the party recieved the Onerous Bow, and the Hellcharger Helm.

Just as they were hitting their stride, however, the party's Troubador, Resonance, was lured away by a job offer from a Memonek baron who sought familiar humor. Resonance left the same day, leaving the rest of the party needing additional members.
