On Saturday, April 26, 2025 we got together for our first session of actual play.

## Navigating the Arajaale Tropics

The party began the session by descending the mountains into the [Arajaale Tropics](/codex/regions/arajaale-tropics).

<div class="box-note" markdown="1">
As you descend from the pass, you leave behind wind-scoured cliffs and the bitter cold of the highlands. As you descend the steep switchbacks, the world changes. A vast, emerald valley stretches out below, swathed in clouds of mist. This is the Arajaale Tropics: a place where the jungle doesn’t just grow—it hungers. Trees rise like towers, vines crawl over stone in minutes, and every breath you take feels thick with life and magic.

The descent begins slowly, looping back on itself in a lengthy and tight switchbacks. Only a third of the way down the mountain's face heat rises to meet you, sticky and fragrant with moss and rain. The sounds of the jungle grow as you continue to descend—distant calls, strange hums, and the ever-present whisper of leaves in motion. Though you walk what would be a well-worn path anywhere else, this jungle works tirelessly to reclaim the road. Only green marble waystones—smooth and polished—hold the growth at bay, carving out a fragile trail through the chaos.

Your destination lies deep within the Arajaale Tropics. Shadowcrest Vale is the the only major city in this enchanted valley. Shadowcrest Vale is the region’s beating heart—a place of refuge, trade, secrets, and stories waiting to be written. From there, the tropics open in every direction. Forgotten ruins, lost temples, and strange tribes dot the map, just waiting for you to discover them.

For now, though, you have to navigate the jungle to arrive at what you hope will serve as your new home base.

The party began following a series of green marble waystones, which are meant to guide them to [Shadowcrest Vale](/codex/regions/shadowcrest-vale). As they continued through the tropics they briefly lost track of the waystones. While trying to find their way back to the path, they discovered a trail left by someone or something in trouble.

## Stopping the Blood Cult

After identifying how to follow the trail, and realizing that it was a human in distress who left this trail, the party decided to follow it.

<div class="box-note" markdown="1">
The trail is faint, almost accidental—broken branches, smeared footprints in the soft earth, a thread of dark blood soaking into fallen leaves. Something—or someone—has come a long way through the jungle, fast and alone.

You find her near the roots of a crooked fig tree, collapsed in the underbrush like a discarded doll. Her body is curled into itself, trembling, slick with blood, sweat, and mud. Her breath is shallow and ragged. Her skin is streaked with old bruises and fresh wounds, and her arms bear strange cuts—thin, deliberate, in looping, ritualistic patterns. Her clothes are in tatters, torn by both claw and clawing branches. She's been running from something.

Insects buzz hungrily around her—drawn to the salt and the blood. Her eyes flutter open as you approach, but there’s no recognition in them—just raw fear. She tries to move, but only manages a twitch. One hand, slick with blood, fumbles at her side, reaching for something that isn't there.

"Help, please."

In the first montage test of the session, the party worked together to stabilize the victim and to track down the blood cult. Using locally sourced medicinal herbs, revitalizing limericks, calming persuasion, and tactical acuity, the party managed to revive the victim who had been teetering at the brink of death, and to identify that a blood cult was planning to summon some kind of terrible monster.

### Finding the Ritual Chamber

With only a couple of hours left, the party continued the second round of the montage test, following the trail to find the location of the Blood Cult's ritual chamber. The party tracked footprints, asked for help from a panther, distracted guards, and scouted the cave complex to know just how many enemies they would face. Finally, they discovered the ritual chamber.

### Stopping the Ritual

<div class="box-note" markdown="1">
The tunnel ends with double doors which you open a crack, allowing you to see into the room. The air is stale, thick with iron and the weight of something profane.

The doors open onto a wide cavern, the walls bare and bone-dry, as if the jungle’s creeping life refuses to enter. No moss, no roots, no lichen—just cold stone and the smell of blood.

At the chamber’s center yawns a massive pit, filled with blood. It is unnaturally bright, almost glowing. The torchlight flickers against it, casting ripples of red across the walls. A stone path winds along the left edge of the cavern, climbing to an altar built into a rocky outcropping that overlooks the pool.

Along the path you can see victims, each bound in manacles driven into the stone walls. They’re alive, barely. Gagged and bloodied, their eyes wide with terror. One tries to squirm away, feebly, but the chains hold fast.

Above, at the altar, a robed cult leader stands over another victim. The chanting stops.

With a single deliberate motion the cultist draws a curved blade across the victim’s throat. Blood pours across the stone, and with a casual push, the body is cast into the pit below. Blood drips from the outcropping into the pool below.

More cultists occupy the cave—hooded figures with blades in hand, watching and waiting. You’ve only got moments before another life is lost.

"Sieze the interlopers!" the cult leader says, having noticed the door open.

The party charged into the ritual chamber, quickly slaying a number of blood cult acolytes, only for the acolytes to rise from the dead and resume the battle.

In a tense series of turns, several of which ended with Resonance having been shoved into the roiling pit of blood, the party ultimately defeated Darren and Cressida Wivek and their cultists and stopped the summoning ritual. Unfortunately, the youngest of the cult leaders Dougie Wivek aka [Zalthorax the Deathbringer](/codex/characters/zalthorax-the-deathbringer) managed to escape using a teleportation device.

The party rescued three of the victims, recovered some helpful magical items and the blood cult's grimoire.

After finishing their work searching the Blood Cult's hideout, the party escorted the victims to Shadowcrest Vale.
