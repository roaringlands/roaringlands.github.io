On Saturday, September 13, 2025 and Saturday, September 27, 2025 we got together for our sixth and seventh session.

## Job Hunting
After an evening's rest, the party visited the [Adventure Society Campus](/codex/regions/adventure-society-campus) to try to find a job. They met [Bet](/codex/characters/albert-alberici) who explained that very few jobs had been showing up, and that the one available job was one that had already been taken by one adventuring team, without finding any monsters. The only reason the job was available was that no other adventurers seemed to want it.

Rather than accept the job immediately accept the job, the party decided to explore [Shadowcrest Vale](/codex/regions/shadowcrest-vale) some more and visit the [Dark End](/codex/regions/dark-end). Immediately after entering Dark End, they were greeted by a squirrely looking man, offering to guide them along the crowded streets. [Anak](/codex/characters/anak) paid him a few coins, and he agreed to take them to one of Dark End's more prosperous taverns.

### Mob Bosses, Smuggling, & Gentrification
After explaining that they were looking for work [](),the squirrely guy, agreed to make an introduction, but he couldn't be blamed if the job didn't work out. He took them to the [Shadowed Tavern](/codex/regions/the-shadowed-tavern). Shortly after entering the tavern, the party was introduced to [Murray](/codex/characters/murray) who, after sounding the party out, offered them a starter job, preventing the purchase of a specific plot of land by a business in [Market Town](/codex/regions/market-town).

The party accepted the job and began to investigate both Murray and the property. Through a series of hilarious and surprisingly successful investigative tactics, including a sneak-thief break-in to Murray's office by the largest and least stealthy party member, intimidation and strongarming a business agent, and spying on the property, the party discovered that the property they'd been hired to protect was home to one of Murray's many smuggling operations. They also discovered that the business wanted to gentrify the block, thereby making a bunch of money.

Rather than attempt to destroy the property, or scare off the buyers, the party decided to negotiate. They got Murray and a representative of the business in the same room and began a negotiation, attempting to convince both parties to make an agreement. Using cunning and good business sense, they brokered an agreement in which the company would purchase property belonging to one of Murray's rivals, and Murray would offer them protection in exchange for laundering money for him.

## A Questionable Job
After finishing their negotiation, the party returned to the Adventure Society Campus and reluctantly accepted the only remaining job.

They journeyed a day east and talked with the bamboo farmer who reported sighting monsters that "et his dog". The party couldn't find any tracks, but kept investigating anyway. Eventually, they discovered a hole in reality in the middle of a bamboo forest. A demon leapt from the tear in reality and attacked [Fellyr](/codex/characters/fellyr) and then fuzzed out of reality, just like Ward tends to do.

### A Running Battle
After a brief debate, the party charged forward into the tear in reality, and entered a hellscape filled with winding tunnels and hordes of demons. The party fought their way through the tunnels, until suddenly Ward fuzzed out and disappeared from the battle. The party fought on, unsure of what happened, but determined to find why this portal existed and stop it.

After fighting their way through some more tunnels, the party found their way into a wide passage that lead into the belly of a volcano, in which they saw a Black Obelisk and a hellmouth spewing forth waves of demons. The party fought their way forward, releasing a lava-flow and hurling demons into the lava to burn. It was a difficult battle, but the party managed to destroy the Obelisk, halt the demon advance, and escape the tunnels before the breach to their own reality faded from existence.
