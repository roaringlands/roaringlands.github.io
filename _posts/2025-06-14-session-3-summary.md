On Saturday, June 14, 2025 we got together for our third session.

## Upcoming News
At the beginning of the session we discussed that we will not be holding any sessions during July. We also mentioned that Jeremy will be returning to college in August, so the next session will be his last as part of our group. We will be looking for a new player to join our group.

## Arriving at Redwater Crossing
When the party arrived at Redwater Crossing they gathered information from locals, learning that livestock had been dragged into the river and killed. More, the villagers had heard resonant bells coming over the water. Additionally, the families near where the sightings had happened hadn't been seen for a bit over a week.

When the players arrived at the fishing cottage and the neighboring farm, they investigated and discovered that the bootlegger living in the fishing cottage had been killed, and that the family next door had fled the area after their livestock were killed. As the party debated on a plan of attack, they ehard a resonant bell from across the river.

### Fighting the Angulotl
The players quickly came up with a plan, with Dead Tam taking position on the roof of the fishing cottage, while Fellyr and Resonance set fire to the other house. Then, just as a greenish glowing light appeared in the gloom over the river, Angulotl rose from the river, ambushing the characters.

Although Anak nearly died from the toxic skin of the Angulotl, and several other characters were nearly overwhelmed, the party ended up killing all of the Rabid Angulotl and returnign to the village to report that the dangerous creatures had been dealt with, though at the cost of one family's entire home and all of their remaining posessions.

After a night of rest, the party set out for the next contract on their list.

## Next Steps
Over the next two weeks, the party has committed to complete as many of the following contracts as they can, in a meandering loop across the Arajaale Tropics.

#### Contract 3: Trouble at Spindle Hollow
**Travel Time:** 2 days to Spindle Hollow  
**Reported Monster:** Goblins (8–12)  
**Summary:** Miners at Spindle Hollow have reported sabotage: collapsed tunnels, stolen tools, and torchlight spotted in the deep shafts. They suspect a goblin tribe has taken up residence in the old silver veins.

#### Contract 4: Stones that Breathe
**Travel Time:** 3 days to the slopes of Tamar’s Rise  
**Reported Monster:** Ogres (2)  
**Summary:** A traveling tinker claims to have seen "two massive stone-skinned beasts" dragging a cart into the jungle. He says they were “chanting” in broken Caelian and eating something raw.

#### Contract 5: Thorns in the Canopy
**Travel Time:** 2 days returning toward Shadowcrest Vale  
**Reported Monster:** Unknown, something flying  
**Summary:** Scouts report strange activity above the jungle near the Canopy Verge. Vines have rapidly overgrown entire clearings overnight. A patrolling courier described “something huge with wings and thorns” attacking a nesting site.

## Out of Character
Jeremy will be giving the session summary for our next session, which is scheduled for June 14, 2025.
