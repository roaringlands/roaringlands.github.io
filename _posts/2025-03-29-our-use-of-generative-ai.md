The use of generative AI is an incredibly divisive issue. It's also one which I belive is more nuanced than the hardcore proponents of either extreme want to acknowledge.

In the below article, I will outline a few of the major arguments against generative AI, for it, and then describe the commitment I make regarding my uses of this technology.

## Why Generative AI is Problematic
In all of my research regarding generative AI, I've uncovered a few key issues that are cited more often than any others.
1. **Copyright, Credit Due, and Loss of Revenue:** This appears to be at the core of almost every complaint raised by content creators. Generative AI has been trained on the work product of many artists, writers, and other professionals without their knowledge or consent, and they are not being given either credit or compensation for the use of their work. There is no argument to be made here. **This is wrong.**
1. **Quality:** Generative AI simply cannot produce works that are as good as those created by a skilled professional. In most AI artwork there are still major artifacts, text created using generative AI tends to be repetetive and formulaic. Even worse, generative AI is often outright wrong or prejudicial regarding factual or historical events.
1. **Atrophy of Talent:** If people turn to generative AI instead of developing talent on their own, artistic talents will atrophy. In the worst case, enough people will cease trying to become artists and we will be subjected to mindless remixes without any new creative energy being channeled into artwork.
1. **Deceptive Content:** There are few, if any, controls identifying what content is AI generated and which is not. We should be able to distinguish what has been created by a person and what has been created by a machine.

## Why Generative AI is Useful
Despite these serious concerns, it is impossible to deny that proponents of generative AI have some good points to make.
1. **Ubiquity:** Generative AI has become increasingly ubiquitous across all technological platforms. Any web search begins with an AI summary of the search results, even professional tools like those created by Adobe are integrating generative AI tools. It is virtually impossible to avoid generative AI, and stubbornly acting as if generative AI doesn't exist won't help anyone.
1. **Low Cost:** Generative AI is far, far cheaper than trying to hire a professional to create content. This can be a very compelling point for many people.
1. **Specificity:** When using generative AI it is easy to get exactly what you hope to get, with more ease and precision than is possible short of commissioning specific artworks.
1. **Shortened Timelines:** Many proponents of generative AI cite lengthy timelines and wait periods for commissioned content. While these wait times are understandable, it is often difficult to find a professional who has the availability to create the content you need in the timeframe in which you need it.

## My Commitments Regarding Generative AI
1. **No Profit:** I promise that, if I attempt to make money in **any** way, I will not use content created using generative AI in the product, marketing, etc.
1. **Credit Wherever Possible:** I promise to credit the creators who contribute to or inspire my work.
1. **Identify AI Created Content:** I promise that any AI generated content will be clearly marked as AI generated, either on the content itself, or at the bottom of a page with that content.
1. **Honor Removal Requests:** If your content was not credited correctly, was used without permission, or clearly acted as a key source for any AI generated content, I will gladly take that content down immediately! Just let me know!
