On Saturday, August 9, 2025 we got together for our fifth session.

## New Players
This week we welcomed two new players, Jon (playing Ward, the Outworlder Null) and Danny (playing Vercingetorix, the Dragon Knight Shadow). They're both new to Draw Steel and our game group, so we reviewed the information from Session 0.

## Meeting the New Party Members
After waking up from a respite, the party recieved word that [Bert](/codex/characters/albert-alberici) wanted to talk to them. When they arrived at the [Adventure Society Campus](/codex/regions/adventure-society-campus) Bert introduced them to Ward and Vercingetorix. To test their compatibility with the party, the group took on a contract to hunt down an unknown monster that acts a lot like a basilisk.

### Fighting the Beaverlisk
The party traveled a few hours away and met with the mayor of the town. It took almost no time for them to realize that the creature they were hunting is actually a beaverlisk. Much like basilisks, the beaverlisk transforms its victims using its eye beams.

Because the party arrived to town in the evening, they decided to rest at the inn. In the middle of the night the beaverlisk attacked the town. The party successfully defended the town and took down the beaverlisk.

Ward showed off his looting power, and managed to salvage a small vial of refined beaverlisk salve as well as a beaverlisk pelt, useful for crafting a variety of armors.
