Welcome to the Roaring Lands!

If you've found this page, it means you're a potential player in our game!

### The Roaring Lands
The Roaring Lands are a world that Tara and I created based on several things which really inspired us. The Roaring Lands are a place where mercenary bands (just called Bands from now on) take up arms to protect civilization and earn fabulous wealth and glory. Players can expect to find an amalgamation of ideas from different media.

Initially, the heroes of the story will be normal people who are placed in a dangerous situation. Those who survive can expect to rise quickly in power, becoming more powerful than most people in the world in only a short time. That said, the monsters that populate this world, the [Rabid](/codex/the-rabid) are just as powerful, if not more so. You are heroes, a force for good in the world, and you have a chance to save the world. Not just from the [Rabid](/codex/the-rabid), but from threats you have yet to discover.

{: .box-note}
Our primary inspiration behind this world are [RWBY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RWBY), [Kings of the Wyld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_of_the_Wyld), and [He Who Fights with Monsters](https://hewhofightswithmonsters.com/)
