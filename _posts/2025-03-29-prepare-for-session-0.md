Welcome to the Roaring Lands!

If you've found this page, it means you're a potential player in our game!

### The Roaring Lands
The Roaring Lands are a world that Tara and I created based on several things which really inspired us. The Roaring Lands are a place where mercenary bands (just called Bands from now on) take up arms to protect civilization and earn fabulous wealth and glory. Players can expect to find an amalgamation of ideas from different media.

Initially, the heroes of the story will be normal people who are placed in a dangerous situation. Those who survive can expect to rise quickly in power, becoming more powerful than most people in the world in only a short time. That said, the monsters that populate this world, the [Rabid](/codex/the-rabid) are just as powerful, if not more so. You are heroes, a force for good in the world, and you have a chance to save the world. Not just from the [Rabid](/codex/the-rabid), but from threats you have yet to discover.

{: .box-note}
Our primary inspiration behind this world are [RWBY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RWBY), [Kings of the Wyld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_of_the_Wyld), and [He Who Fights with Monsters](https://hewhofightswithmonsters.com/)

### Game Schedule & Attendance

{: .box-error}
**Important:** Session Zero will be held on Saturday, April 12, 2025 at 1pm.

{: .box-warning}
Game sessions will be held on the second and fourth Saturday of each month from 1pm to 5pm, at our home in Liberty.

I expect players to attend regularly and to arrive on time. That being said, life happens, and we will understand if you cannot make it one week. Please just let us know as early as possible so I can plan ahead.

We will cancel sessions under only a few conditions:
1. I am unable to host (including for sickness, events with higher priority, etc)
1. There will be fewer than 3 players, total.

In all other cases, though we may not progress our campaign story, we will still get together and do something else. This is time we get to spend with friends doing things we like. Let's make the most of it.

If your schedule, ability to commit, etc. changes in the future please let the group know at the beginning of the next session, and we will work together to allow the game to continue. (THE GAME MUST GO ON!)

Finally, if our group decides to handle specific parts of the game, such as respite activities or leveling up, outside of the normally scheduled game session, each player is expected to complete these activities before the next session or lose all benefits that they would have gained.

In other words, be a grown-up about it. If you need help, just ask.

### Creating Characters
We will create characters in person during session 0.

### House Rules & Homebrew
I don't have any house rules or homebrew I'm going to use at the moment. If I come up with some, I'll add it to the [Codex](/codex).
