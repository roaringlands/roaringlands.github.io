On Saturday, April 12, 2025 we got together for session 0. Session zero is a session during which we don't actually play our characters. Instead, we dicsuss important aspects of playing the game, but which are often only tangentially related to gameplay itself.

We also created characters and helped each other to flesh out our backstories and how the adventuring party came to work together.

## Campaign & Sessions
This section covers important topics such as content, campaign scope, and more.

### Campaign Length & Scope
This campaign is going to last for between 2 and 6 months, though it could continue longer if players wish to continue beyond that point. This campaign is meant to be a learning experience during which players become familiar with Draw Steel in preparation for a more in-depth Mass Effect game I have been working on.

### Schedule
We will meet on the 2nd and 4th Saturdays of each month, from 1pm until 5pm.

### Attendance Expectations
All players are expected to be grown ups. Let the group know over the Discord server if you will not be able to attend a session. Please let us know as soon as you are aware you will not be able to attend. If you are going to be late, again, just let us know!

### Adventure Logs
I, as the director, will write an adventure log going over what happened during the last session. It normally won't take us more than a day or two to get the adventure log written and published.

### Session Recaps
Each session will open with a recap of events from the last few sessions. Players will prepare and deliver these recaps. We will rotate through players so that everyone gets the chance to provide a recap.

### Snacks
Tara and I will provide drinks and snacks for each session. We will provide a combination of sweet, salty, and sour snacks. If snack consumption becomes excessive, we may ask that the players help to provide snacks.

### Devices at the Table
We welcome your devices and digital character sheets and tools at the table. If they become a distraction, however, you may be asked to stop using them.

### Content Guidelines
If anything at the table makes you uncomfortable, just speak up. We won't ask for explanations, but will just move on. We may ask about the topic or situation that was a prolem later, but only so that we can be aware of what to avoid in the future.

## Game Mechanics
Each game is unique, and there are a few specific points we covered in relation to game mechanics.

### Dealiness of the Game
*DRAW STEEL* is an inherently deadly game. Player characters may die, but if they do die, players can create a new character or promote a retainer into a new player character.

### Rules vs Rulings
We are all learning *DRAW STEEL* togehter, and we're bound to run into situations where we don't know what to do next. In order not to slow down play, I will make a ruling about how to proceed in the moment, and we can verify and make corrections later.

### No Unannounced Rolls
Players shouldn't assume that they can just make a roll without letting both the director and other players know waht they plan. Once again, be respectful of everyone else and the game itself.

## Tone and Theme
Understanding the tone and theme of the game is important for players and for the director.

### Heroes, not Murder-Hobos
The player characters in *DRAW STEEL* are meant to be heroes. That means you try to help people, and your motivations are generally altruistic.

### We're All Friends Here
While it can be fun for characters to argue form time-to-time, that doesn't mean that players should argue. Keep your arguments between your characters.

### Focus of the Game
This campaign will have a wide ranging set of themes. I, as director, will offer a number of plot hooks that the players can choose to follow or ignore. The direction the game goes will be based on the choices the players make.

## Character Creation
We worked to create and connect player characters as part of a group.

### Anak
[Anak](/codex/characters/anak) is a Hakaan Fury who comes from a mountain village. For many years, Anak was on the path to become a craftsperson in his village, but those plans were interrupted by an invasion of mercenaries. A group of violent mercenaries took over Anak's hometown, subjugating the inhabitants. When Anak tried to resist, he was thrown in a dungeon for more than a year.

During his time locked away, Anak formed alliances with an underground resistance and learned valuable skills. Eventually, after the main force of the mercenary band left his village, Anak managed to break free and drive the remaining dregs of the [Red Boots](/codex/organizations/red-boots) from his hometown. Since then, he's searched for allies who can help him to become strong enough to destroy the [Red Boots](/codex/organizations/red-boots) and prevent them from hurting others the way he was hurt.

Eventually he found the rest of the party and asked if he could join them in their quest to gain power and help people in need.

### "Dead" Tam Steeljaw
["Dead" Tam Steeljaw](/codex/characters/dead-tam-stelljaw) is a Revenant Tactician, and one-time elite solider of the [Red Boots](/codex/organizations/red-boots). As a young man, Tam joined up with a mercenary company along with his best friend. Neither really knew the reputation or disposition of the mercenaries, but soon learned that the [Red Boots Mercenaries](/codex/organizations/red-boots) were among the most brutal and unforgiving mercenary organizations in the world.

Tam thrived in the brutal organization, fighting through debilitating injuries and slaying foes with ruthless efficiency. His actions impressed the leadership of the [Red Boots](/codex/organizations/red-boots) enough that he was inducted into their leadership by receiving the [Rite of Awakening](/codex/the-rite-of-awakening). The power of the ritual and his magical [Awakening](/codex/the-awakened) restored his body, replacing his missing mandible with one made of steel, and his missing arm with one made of magical stone.

Unfortunately, Tam's friend couldn't handle the depravity of the [Red Boots](/codex/organizations/red-boots). He attempted to flee and was brutally tortured and executed for his desertion. Though Tam loved life as a mercenary, their betrayal of his best friend made them his enemies. He attempted to take on the leaders of the company, and instead of killing him outright, they staked him out to starve and be eaten by Rabid.

Tam died.

But his rage and desire for revenge would not allow him to remain dead. He returned as a Revenant, intent on hunting down and dismantling the [Red Boots](/codex/organizations/red-boots), and becoming someone his friend could be proud to call a friend. More the former than the latter, but they're both motivations.

Eventually Tam was found by [Fellyr](/codex/characters/fellyr) and freed from his bonds. The two of them have stuck together since, forming something of a strange friendship.

### Fellyr
[Fellyr](/codex/characters/fellyr) is a Wode Elf Elementalist who was raised as part of a secret commune. She was trained from childhood to take on the role of a [Wild Warden](/codex/organizations/wild-wardens). Once she was old enough, Fellyr was inducted into the order, and granted [copper tier](/codex/tiers-of-awakening). As part of this ritual she was implanted with an elemental spirit, imprisoning it, but also using it to fuel her own magical power.

Over time, Fellyr became disillusioned with the isolationist ways of her home clan. She began to question the wisdom of only helping others from her community when their power could help so many others. When she found ["Dead" Tam Steeljaw](/codex/characters/dead-tam-stelljaw) chained up near her patrol area, she freed him and left her home to help her new friend and the world as a whole.

### Resonance
[Resonance](/codex/characters/resonance) is a Memonek Troubador who tried to embrace the emotion of humor, music, and performance. Unfortunately, as a Memonek, Resonance didn't understand the emotions he was trying to invoke. he failed as a court jester, failed as a bard, and failed as a street performer. 

Fortunately, however, his lack of emotional intelligence didn't keep him from investigating an abandoned caravan that seemed to be transporting low-end musical instruments. Inside a damaged lute, Resonance found a rare and powerful [Awakening Stone](/codex/items/awakening-stone). He used the last of his money paying for the [Rite of Awakening](/codex/the-rite-of-awakening).

In an effort to make enough money to live, Resonance tried his hand at street-corner comedy. His disastrous attempt was salvaged by a chance meeting with [Fellyr](/codex/characters/fellyr) and ["Dead" Tam Steeljaw](/codex/characters/dead-tam-stelljaw). Though they couldn't keep the town from kicking Resonance out of the town, they were able to team up and form an adventuring party that would work together to become stronger and help the world.
