On Saturday, May 10, 2025 we got together for our second session.

## Exploring Shadowcrest Vale
After a couple of days in the jungles of the [Arajaale Tropics](/codex/regions/arajaale-tropics) leading the victims of the Blood Cult, the party finally reached [Shadowcrest Vale](/codex/regions/shadowcrest-vale). As they entered the city, they noted that the city is constantly working to fight back against the incessant growth of magical plant-life.

The party first decided to seek out lodging for the night, and made their way into the [Green Well](/codex/regions/green-well). Here, unlike the rest of Shadowcrest Vale, city workers don't attempt to cut back the jungle growth. Instead, they weave the growth into the structures the citizens of the ward live in. The streets are made of dirt, but are well-maintained and clear of most undergrowth, by virtue of the plentiful foot traffic.

Fellyr asked for directions to [The Towering Gardens](/codex/regions/the-towering-gardens), an adventuing inn the party had heard of. A local hunter and scavenger helped give them directions. Following those directions, the party found their way to the river, which carved a wide and ravine between the two halves of the city. After turning east and walking for a ways, the party encountered [Bert](/codex/characters/hubert-alberici.md), a street-food vendor who offered them delicious fried lizard intestines and gave them directions to their inn.

### A Suspiciously Attractive Firbolg
Upon entering the Towering Gardens, the party immediately met [Vaneiros Oakenpetal](/codex/characters/vaneiros-oakenpetal), the Silver [Tier](/codex/tiers-of-awakening) and suspiciously attractive proprietor of the inn. They rented rooms and asked questions about Shadowcrest Vale, discovering a few notable poitns of interest. 

### An Ambitious Plan
The next morning, the party made their way to the [Aventurer Society Campus](/codex/regions/adventure-society-campus) to register as adventurers operating out of Shadowcrest Vale. During their visit to the campus, the party also visited the jobs hall, where they decided to pick up six one-star contracts to hunt monsters in a wide two-week loop through the tropics. Here they met [Bert](/codex/characters/albert-alberici.md), the contracts agent, and discovered that he was not only related to [Bert], the street vendor, but also had six **more** brothers living in Shadowcrest Vale.

### Forgetting to Buy Stuff
After finishin in the Adventurer Society, the party visited the [Arcane Exchange](/codex/regions/the-arcane-exchange), and found their way to the most established shop in the arcade, [The Exalted Forest](/codex/regions/the-exalted-forest). Run by two vampires, this shop was guarded by a half-ogre bouncer, who checks everyone's weapons at the doors.

Inside the shop, lighted with perpetual twilight, the party met both [Kassoum Yaro](/codex/characters/kassoum-yaro) and his wife, [Melantha](/codex/characters/melantha-yaro). After showing the shopkeepers the grimoire they obtained from the Blood Cult, Kassoum informed the party that they could complete a high-value 3-star contract. After some further discussion the party realized that the cult leaders were, in fact, influential nobility within Shadowcrest Vale. Worse, they were friends to the Duke. Kassoum pointed out that there could very well be significant political backlash for killing them, even if the two were part of a blood cult.

On advice from Melantha, the party decided that it would be a good idea to discuss how best to handle the situation with Vaneiros Oakenpetal before turning in the grimoire and trying to claim completion of the contract.

### Stepping in the Brown Stuff
The party returned to the Towering Gardens and began to ask Vaneiros for advice. Well before they finished their explanation, Vaneiros explained to them just how wide and deep the river of crap they had stumbled into really was. The survivors who had returned with the party had reported to the city guard, and instead of being believed, were arrested and accused of being cultists who killed Cressida and Darren Wyss. Their execution dates were set for the next evening.

In order to try to protect the party, and in exchange for a favor, Vaneiros offered to try to limit the damage and save the innocent victims. The party would have to leave immediately, so that nothing Vaneiros did would blow back on them.

## Starting Your Circuit
The party set out for their first contract in the circuit. They camped overnight and tracked down their targets.

### Contract 1: Fighting the Gnoll
**Travel Time:** 1 day out of Shadowcrest Vale
**Reported Monster:** Gnoll (4)
The party tracked what was supposed to be a small pack of [Rabid](/codex/the-rabid) gnoll. Dangerous, sure, but manageable. When the party found the pack, they discovered eight hyenas and another eight gnoll wildlings. This pack was much larger than expected, and as the battle commenced, the party discovered that the contract was sadlly mistaken, as a gnoll marauder and gnoll carnage both appeared with a batch of eight more minions.

Though it was a hard-fought battle, ultimately the party destroyed the last of the rabid, earning two victories as a result.

## Next Steps
Over the next two weeks, the party has committed to complete as many of the following contracts as they can, in a meandering loop across the Arajaale Tropics.

#### Contract 2: Bells at Redwater
**Travel Time:** 1.5 days from Gnoll report
**Reported Monster:** Angulotl (12)
**Summary:** Villagers in Redwater Crossing report hearing deep, resonant bell-like calls echoing through the night and finding large gouges carved into the mud near the river. Livestock have gone missing—dragged into the jungle. Locals speak of a “singing beast” that lures animals away.

#### Contract 3: Trouble at Spindle Hollow
**Travel Time:** 2 days to Spindle Hollow
**Reported Monster:** Goblins (8–12)
**Summary:** Miners at Spindle Hollow have reported sabotage: collapsed tunnels, stolen tools, and torchlight spotted in the deep shafts. They suspect a goblin tribe has taken up residence in the old silver veins.

#### Contract 4: Stones that Breathe
**Travel Time:** 3 days to the slopes of Tamar’s Rise
**Reported Monster:** Ogres (2)
**Summary:** A traveling tinker claims to have seen "two massive stone-skinned beasts" dragging a cart into the jungle. He says they were “chanting” in broken Caelian and eating something raw.

#### Contract 5: Thorns in the Canopy
**Travel Time:** 2 days returning toward Shadowcrest Vale
**Reported Monster:** Unknown, something flying
**Summary:** Scouts report strange activity above the jungle near the Canopy Verge. Vines have rapidly overgrown entire clearings overnight. A patrolling courier described “something huge with wings and thorns” attacking a nesting site.
