The Roaring Lands are home to the the Rabid, a wandering host of creatures that appear at seeming random and attack any sign of civilization they encounter. The Rabid aren’t the only creatures to call The Roaring Lands home. All kinds of peoples live all across the Roaring Lands. These peoples live and thrive despite the near-constant threat of the Rabid. After all, life always finds a way.

Much of the prejudice and distrust that exists between the races in other worlds does not exist here. Instead, if your neighbor is a Bugbear, that is likely to be good for you, since Bugbears tend to be bigger and have greater reach than a Gnome. That said, against most Rabid, no amount of reach or normal physical prowess will be enough.

All creatures in the Roaring Lands are made up of different amounts of raw magic. Most of the peoples of the Roaring Lands are not naturally imbued with as much magic as are the [Rabid](/codex/the-rabid). Only by awakening, and later strengthening a normal creature’s magical affinity can they hope to stand against most Rabid. [Magical awakening](/codex/the-rite-of-awakening) is expensive, taxing, and frequently dangerous. Relatively few people have the wealth, influence, or luck necessary to obtain the necessary materials. Those fortunate few change over time from creatures of flesh and blood to near-immortal beings of incredible power, called [Awakened](/codex/the-awakened).

The need to fight the [Rabid](/codex/the-rabid) has changed the world in numerous, subtle ways. Common people do not attempt to defend their homes, businesses, or crops from the Rabid. Instead, they gather their loved ones and leave when they or someone nearby spots a Rabid. Then, once they are safer, they register the sighting with a branch of the The [Global Mercenary Guild](/codex/global-mercenaries-guild).

This is where Bands come into play. Almost all Bands are contracted with the GMG, and take on contracts to hunt down monsters that appear and threaten normal people. These Bands are paid by the Guild based on the danger or inconvenience of the contract. While many Bands are based around a single major population center, bands who grow in popularity and power will often “go on tour” seeking more lucrative and prestigious contracts.

Unlike normal citizens, Bands are free from most of the strictures of normal law and proceedings. After all, who but another [Awakened](/codex/the-awakened) can even attempt to stop a dedicated group of super-humans?
