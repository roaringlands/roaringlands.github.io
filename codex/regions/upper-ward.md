The Upper Ward of Shadowcrest Vale is a realm of opulence and privilege, where the elite of society dwell amidst the splendor of the Duke’s fortress and the lavish estates that dot the landscape. Perched atop a towering natural outcropping, the Duke’s stronghold commands a commanding view of the city below, its formidable walls of polished green marble standing as a testament to both its power and prestige.

Unlike the rest of the city, where nature’s embrace is omnipresent, the Upper Ward bears the mark of human intervention. The gleaming walls of the palace have been imbued with powerful enchantments, warding off the relentless encroachment of the magical jungle that surrounds it. Here, the verdant tendrils that cling to every surface elsewhere in Shadowcrest Vale find no purchase, halted by the resilient barrier of enchanted stone.

Within the confines of the Upper Ward, a select few hold sway over the affairs of the city, their lofty positions secured by birthright or wealth. Nobles and aristocrats move with an air of effortless grace through streets lined with stately mansions and manicured gardens, their every whim attended to by a retinue of loyal servants and skilled artisans.

Merchants, drawn by the promise of wealth and influence, vie for the favor of the elite, their wares displayed in ornate storefronts that cater to the tastes of the nobility. Behind closed doors, bustling markets give way to elegant salons and opulent ballrooms, where the rich and powerful gather to scheme and socialize amidst the trappings of luxury.

The Upper Ward is not without its tensions. Beneath the veneer of civility lies a web of intrigue and rivalry, as ambitious courtiers vie for the Duke’s favor and merchants seek to outmaneuver their rivals in the pursuit of profit. In this world of high stakes and cutthroat politics, alliances are fleeting and betrayals commonplace, as each resident of the Upper Ward seeks to carve out their own place in the hierarchy of Shadowcrest Vale.
