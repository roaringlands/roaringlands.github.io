Nestled within the heart of the [Upper Ward](/codex/regions/upper-ward), the Emerald Gardens stand as a verdant oasis amidst the urban landscape. This sprawling botanical paradise boasts a diverse array of exotic flora, carefully curated to showcase the beauty and diversity of the natural world. Lush greenery spills over ornate marble pathways, while vibrant blooms perfume the air with their intoxicating scent. Within the garden’s confines, visitors can wander among towering trees and tranquil ponds, finding respite from the hustle and bustle of city life. The Emerald Gardens serve not only as a sanctuary for the elite of Shadowcrest Vale but also as a venue for extravagant soirees and elegant garden parties, where the city’s aristocracy gather to see and be seen.
