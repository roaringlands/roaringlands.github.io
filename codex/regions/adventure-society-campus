Positioned on the border between [The Hill](/codex/regions/the-hill) and [The Upper Ward](/codex/regions/upper-ward), the Adventure Society Campus serves as the command center for exploration and Rabid hunting contracts in the [Arajaale Tropics](/codex/regions/arajaale-tropics). The Campus is a fortified and orderly compound known for its marshaling yard, a wide, cobbled plaza used for staging large expeditions, coordinating supplies, and training. Surrounding it are key facilities: the Administrative Hall, where high-level directives are issued and records kept; the Contracts Hall, where official missions and urgent requests are posted; as well as armories, archives, and a provisioner’s depot.

The Campus itself is the Society’s operational heart—and the second greatest concentration of political influence in the city, rivaled only by the Duke’s court. Though physically separated from the halls of nobility, the Society holds immense sway in civic and frontier matters. From this campus, expeditions are launched, discoveries are catalogued, and the balance of power at the jungle’s edge is quietly shaped.
