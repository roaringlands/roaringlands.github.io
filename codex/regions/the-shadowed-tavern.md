Tucked away in the heart of [Dark End](/codex/regions/dark-end), The Shadowed Tavern is a dimly lit establishment that serves as a gathering place for the wardâ€™s denizens. Housed within a ramshackle building constructed from weathered wood and overgrown with creeping vines, the tavern exudes an aura of mystery and intrigue. Inside, the air is heavy with the scent of stale ale and tobacco smoke, while the dim lighting casts long shadows across the room, obscuring the faces of its patrons. Despite its gloomy atmosphere, the Shadowed Tavern is a place of camaraderie and conviviality, where residents of [Dark End](/codex/regions/dark-end) come together to share stories, drown their sorrows, and forge connections that transcend the boundaries of their troubled surroundings.
