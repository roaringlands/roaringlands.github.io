The exalted forest is a specialized shop catering primarily to [Awakened](/codex/the-awakened) in [Shadowcrest Vale](/codex/regions/shadowcrest-vale). Run by [Kassoum Yaro](/codex/characters/kassoum-yaro) and his wife, [Melantha Yaro](/codex/characters/melantha-yaro), the Exalted Forest has the best selection of rare and valuable magical artifacts in the [Arcane Exchange](/codex/regions/the-arcane-exchange).

No matter the weather or time of day outside the Exalted Forest customers inside the shop are surrounded by cool twilight, lit by the warm light of magical lamps. The lamp-light glitters off of alchemically reinforced glass cases and the items beneath them. Far from being dark or creepy, the atmosphere inside the shop is welcoming and homey.

Just outside the door of the shop sits any one of a dozen different interchangeable brutes. Each one bearing a magically imbued club and guarding a secure lockbox. Every patron is asked to leave any holy symbols or other equipment that might deal radiant damage or generate sunlight.
