Deep within the heart of the dense, untamed jungles of the [Arajaale Tropics](/codex/regions/arajaale-tropics) lies a forgotten relic of a forgotten time—a stone obelisk, standing tall and proud amidst the verdant foliage that surrounds it. Covered in a thick blanket of vines and moss, the obelisk seems almost a part of the natural landscape, its weathered surface blending seamlessly with the ancient trees and tangled undergrowth that encircle it.

As one approaches the obelisk, a sense of solemnity descends upon the scene, as if the very air around it is imbued with a hushed reverence for the mysteries it holds. The jungle itself seems to fall silent in its presence, as if paying homage to the ancient monument that stands as a silent sentinel amidst the greenery.

Indecipherable carvings adorn the surface of the obelisk, their intricate patterns etched into the stone with a precision and artistry that speaks of a craftsmanship long lost to the annals of time. Symbols and glyphs intertwine with scenes of myth and legend, of a civilization that once thrived in the heart of the jungle, only to vanish with almost no trace.

Surrounding the obelisk, there are no other signs of civilization—no crumbling ruins, no forgotten temples, no ancient artifacts to hint at the people who once called this place home. It is as if the obelisk stands alone, a solitary monument to a bygone era, its secrets locked away within its silent stone.

And so the forgotten stone obelisk stands, a silent witness to the passage of ages, its secrets hidden beneath a cloak of vines and moss, waiting patiently for the day when they will be revealed once more to those who dare to seek them out.

## The Inscription Reads

In the depths where shadows dance,
A still lake lies in silent trance.
Its waters aglow with spectral light,
By luminescent lichen’s might.

Within its bosom, a stone does dwell,
A relic of yore, a hidden spell.
From its depths, the land does feed,
In fertile embrace, its secrets freed.

Yet guarded by spirits, veiled in night,
Whispering secrets, shrouded in fright.
To reach its core, one must dare,
Through winding paths, devoid of air.

But those who brave the journey’s plight,
Shall glimpse the truth, in the lichen’s light.
For in its glow, mysteries unfold,
A tapestry ancient, yet to behold.

Thus sings the tale of the underground lake,
Where ancient whispers, their echoes quake.
In realms obscure, where shadows dwell,
The stone’s power, it shall forever swell.
