As the sun sets over [Market Town](/codex/regions/market-town), a different kind of marketplace comes to life beneath the shimmering light of the stars. The Twilight Market, held every evening in a sprawling plaza at the heart of the ward, is a bustling nocturnal bazaar where vendors peddle their wares until the wee hours of the morning. Illuminated by flickering torches and colorful lanterns, the marketâ€™s labyrinthine alleyways are alive with the sights, sounds, and smells of exotic goods from every corner of the world. Here, visitors can sample exotic street food, peruse stalls selling rare and unusual trinkets, and marvel at the performances of street musicians and acrobats. From dusk till dawn, the Twilight Market offers a feast for the senses and a glimpse into the vibrant tapestry of life in [Shadowcrest Vale](/codex/regions/shadowcrest-vale).
