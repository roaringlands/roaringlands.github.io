Gilbert Alberici—one more in the long line of indistinguishable Alberici brothers and, of course, known as Bert—is the proud owner of Gilbert’s Attire for the Discerning Gentleman, a premier boutique nestled in the heart of the Arcane Exchange. Always impeccably dressed (in his own creations, naturally), Gilbert is a skilled tailor, an enchanter of no small talent, and a businessman with an instinct for luxury and exclusivity.

His shop caters to nobles, mages, and high-ranking adventurers seeking attire that’s as functional as it is fashionable. From runed battlecoats that deflect spells to self-cleaning formalwear, every piece is crafted with precision and flair. Gilbert is known for his exacting standards, tasteful eye, and subtle snobbery—but always delivered with the same genial Alberici smile.

While most can’t tell the Alberici brothers apart, Gilbert insists that he is the only one with “taste, tact, and a tape measure.”
