Finnian Ironhide is tall for a dwarf, standing around five and a half feet tall. His bushy brown beard and matching hair flow down his chest and back in a perpetually glossy cascade.

Finnian’s normal attire consists of blue and brown robes and a staff topped with a sharp blue crystal which can be used as a spear in a pinch. Despite not yet looking his age, his face is lined with permanent smile lines, and even his frowns look vaguely cheerful because of them.
Personality

Finnian is an eternal and unashamed optimist. He is good at drawing out peoples’ stories. He enjoys life to the fullest, but never overindulges.

Finnian is a peacemaker and you can feel animosity and tension bleed away when he becomes involved in a situation.
