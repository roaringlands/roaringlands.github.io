Albert Alberici—known universally as Bert—is a jovial, round-bellied contract agent for the Adventure Society. Balding with a fringe of stubborn hair and a perpetual grin, Bert is known for his warm laugh, booming voice, and bottomless patience. Despite the confusion caused by his six brothers—also named Bert—he somehow always seems to know exactly which Bert someone means.

Though he’s rarely seen outside the Contracts Hall, Bert is a cornerstone of the Society’s daily operations. He has a talent for matching the right adventurer to the right job and is as comfortable brokering sensitive diplomatic missions as he is assigning giant-wasp nest removals. Friendly, reliable, and endlessly enthusiastic, Bert is widely regarded as the glue that keeps the mission board running—and the adventurers sane.
