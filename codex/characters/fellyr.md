Fellyr is a Wode Elf Elementalist who was raised as part of a secret commune. She was trained from childhood to take on the role of a [Wild Warden](/codex/organizations/wild-wardens). Once she was old enough, Fellyr was inducted into the order, and granted [copper tier](/codex/tiers-of-awakening). As part of this ritual she was implanted with an elemental spirit, imprisoning it, but also using it to fuel her own magical power.

Over time, Fellyr became disillusioned with the isolationist ways of her home clan. She began to question the wisdom of only helping others from her community when their power could help so many others. When she found ["Dead" Tam Steeljaw](/codex/characters/dead-tam-stelljaw) chained up near her patrol area, she freed him and left her home to help her new friend and the world as a whole.
