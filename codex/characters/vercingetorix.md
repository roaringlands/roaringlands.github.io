Vercingetorix is a Dragon Knight Shadow. He was hatched beneath an open sky, in the heart of the Sootwind Range, where his clan roamed the shifting plains and ash-dusted hills. His people, the Ashen Banner, were dragonborn who lived without permanent homes, moving with the seasons and telling their history through song, carved bone flutes, and sweeping ash-ink paintings. From a young age, he learned that beauty was as vital as bread, and every warrior was also a poet or craftsman in their own right. Vercingetorix was drawn to the shadow-craft dances, a ceremonial art that blended movement, rhythm, and sleight-of-hand — meant to mimic the disappearing act of prey animals and the shifting haze of volcanic smoke.

When war found the Ashen Banner, Vercingetorix left his people to serve in the Coal Legion, a hard-bitten coalition of mercenaries. His light tread, keen eyes, and training in shadow-dances made him a natural scout. He learned to map enemy routes, set killing grounds, and vanish into terrain as if the land itself had claimed him. But soldiering taught him more than tactics — it taught him the bitterness of fighting for coin, the cruelty of commanders, and the cold fact that no war-song lasts forever.

After years of service, he left the Legion and returned to find the Ashen Banner scattered by famine and border skirmishes. Many had been folded into other clans; others simply vanished into the wider world. Alone but carrying his people’s traditions in his heart, he took to the road as an adventurer.

In time, he found the Black Ash Tradition — a sect of shadow-walkers who believed that darkness was not an absence of light, but a living thing to be courted, respected, and worn like a cloak. Their techniques spoke to his old shadow dances, but infused them with supernatural potency: slipping between spaces in a blink, cloaking himself in ink-black haze, striking unseen from impossible angles.

Now Vercingetorix moves from contract to contract, an ember of his nomadic heritage burning in his chest. His art is war and his war is art — each strike a stanza, each vanish a verse. In every city and campfire ring, he leaves a painted mark in ash and soot, a silent promise that the Ashen Banner is not yet forgotten.
