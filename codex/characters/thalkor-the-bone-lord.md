Thal’kor the Bone Lord is thin, rangy, and attractive in a teenage heartthrob kind of way. He dresses in stylishly decorated robes and vests, with silver embellishments that proclaim his status as a “bone lord”.

Thal’kor acts like being edgy and dark is the coolest thing in the universe. He has befriended Zalthorax because it allows him to see himself as a leader, instead of the spineless nobody he really is.
