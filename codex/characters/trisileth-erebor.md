Trisileth Erebor is a striking woman with piercing green eyes, sharp cheekbones, and an aura of quiet authority. Her golden-blond hair and otherworldly allure hints at her elven heritage, while pale scars on various parts of her body speak to a life spent on battlefields rather than in courtly halls. She favors tailored leather vests with green highlights.

Born to an exiled elven diplomat and a human sellsword, Tris grew up in war camps, learning battle tactics before she could properly read. Her mixed heritage left her an outsiderâ€”never fully accepted in elven society, nor entirely trusted among humans. But on the battlefield, where skill mattered more than blood, she carved out a name for herself.

By her twenties, Tris had led her own band of mercenaries, known for their precision and discipline. Rising to silver tier with a mix of ruthless pragmatism and battlefield brilliance, she now serves as an agent for other bands, managing contracts, brokering new deals with cities in the [Arajaale Tropics](/codex/regions/arajaale-tropics).
