Anak is a Hakaan Fury who comes from a mountain village. For many years, Anak was on the path to become a craftsperson in his village, but those plans were interrupted by an invasion of mercenaries. A group of violent mercenaries took over Anak's hometown, subjugating the inhabitants. When Anak tried to resist, he was thrown in a dungeon for more than a year.

During his time locked away, Anak formed alliances with an underground resistance and learned valuable skills. Eventually, after the main force of the mercenary band left his village, Anak managed to break free and drive the remaining dregs of the [Red Boots](/codex/organizations/red-boots) from his hometown. Since then, he's searched for allies who can help him to become strong enough to destroy the [Red Boots](/codex/organizations/red-boots) and prevent them from hurting others the way he was hurt.

Eventually he found the rest of the party and asked if he could join them in their quest to gain power and help people in need.
