Robert Alberici—known to absolutely everyone as Bert—is one of the indistinguishable Alberici brothers, but where most of his kin dabble in coin, Robert has devoted himself to a higher calling. He is a priest of Knowledge, the god of insight, memory, and relentless inquiry.

Round of belly and bright of eye like all his brothers, Robert is endlessly curious and deeply passionate about the pursuit of truth, whether through scripture, scholarship, or spirited conversation. He travels frequently between shrines and village libraries, giving impromptu sermons and happily engaging any willing (or cornered) soul in debate about ethics, knowledge, and the importance of writing things down properly.

He dresses in the modest robes of his order, usually stained with ink and filled with scribbled notes, loose scrolls, and half-finished essays. Ever cheerful, often long-winded, Robert carries a small brass censor that glows faintly with divine flame and a collapsible lectern for when the need for a sermon strikes—which is often.

Though he looks just like his brothers, Robert insists he’s “the only Bert with a divine mandate to correct your grammar.”
