Ward’s earliest memory of this world is falling. Not from a height, exactly — more like tumbling through a kaleidoscope of color and static. One moment he was sitting in his apartment, half-watching some martial arts tournament on a livestream and half-playing an old VR dungeon crawler. The next, he woke up in a forest that looked like it had been painted over reality, too sharp at the edges, the colors too much.

He spent the first few days convinced it was a lucid dream or some elaborate tech demo he’d accidentally signed up for. People spoke strange languages that somehow made sense. Town guards wore mismatched plate armor straight out of a fantasy MMO. Magic was real, apparently. Ward figured: Fine. I’ll play along until the alarm clock goes off.

But the dream never ended.

Ward discovered something strange: magic just… didn’t work right around him. Spells fizzled, enchantments unraveled, even summoned creatures wavered like bad holograms if they got too close. It wasn’t that he hated magic — he loved watching it — but his very presence tamped it down, like a wet blanket over a campfire. Someone called him a “Null” the first time, and the name stuck.

As weeks turned into months, he adapted. He leaned into the martial arts training he’d picked up back home, but fused it with techniques from local brawlers and sword saints. His fighting style became a rhythm of pressure and disruption — slipping past flaming blades, breaking spellcasting stances, turning enemy wizards into flustered, unarmed civilians.

Then came the disease.

It started as moments of vertigo, as if the floor beneath him had tilted. Then one day, in the middle of a sparring match, he simply wasn’t there anymore — for three long seconds. No pain, no warning, just gone. Since then, the episodes have grown more frequent. He’ll be mid-conversation and vanish; reappear three steps to the left; return with the taste of cold iron in his mouth. The healers call it a “phase sickness,” some obscure malady tied to dimensional instability. Ward just calls it “lag.”

He’s starting to suspect this might be the reason he came here at all — that whatever pulled him in brought the disease with him, or maybe caused it. But until he figures that out, he’s decided to go with the flow. After all, if this is a dream, he might as well make it a good one. And if it’s not…

Well, he’s always wanted to see what happens if you punch a dragon in the face.
