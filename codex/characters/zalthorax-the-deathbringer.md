Zalthorax the Deathbringer is a young necromancer with a perpetual sneer and exquisitely executed (but poorly thought out) bowl-cut. He wears ornate black robes with embellishments embroidered in gold thread.

Zalthorax is deeply insecure. He comes from a long line of powerful wizards, and was Awakened six years ago. He idolizes his fellow necromancer Thal’kor the Bone Lord, and became a necromancer to be more like him.

Zalthorax tries very hard to be dark and edgy, but it is not helping him find happiness. He has yet to realize that his efforts to be like Thal’kor are only making him unhappy.
