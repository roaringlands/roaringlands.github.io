Kassoum Yaro is a tall, round-faced man with an infectious smile and deep belly laugh. He is friendly and outgoing, and has developed friendships throughout [Shadowcrest Vale](/codex/regions/shadowcrest-vale). Kassoum greets everyone who comes into his shop with a genuine smile. Other than his wife, [Melantha](/codex/characters/melantha-yaro), being a merchant is the thing that Kassoum loves most.

He is a ruthless, though pragmatic, businessman. He views repeat customers as the most valuable resource he has, so he treats them fairly. If, on the other hand, there are outsiders just passing through, he will bilk them for everything they’re worth.

Kassoum Yaro is the co-owner of [The Exalted Forest](/codex/regions/the-exalted-forest), the most impressive and profitable shop in [The Arcane Exchange](/codex/regions/the-arcane-exchange). Kassoum’s grandfather founded [the Exalted Forest](/codex/regions/the-exalted-forest), and his father and he inherited the shop in turn.

Kassoum worked in the shop from the time he was ten years old. He learned everything about the economy of magical items. His father trained his son to take over the family business, and Kassoum took to the lessons well. He befriended everyone. His intelligence and gregarious nature endeared him to adults and other kids, not to mention to customers.

As soon as he turned twenty Kassoum became [Awakened](/codex/the-awakened) and started running the shop alongside his father, becoming more and more involved in every aspect of the business. He and his father ran the business in the same way Kassoum’s grandfather had for the last century. At least until [Melantha Yaro](/codex/characters/melantha-yaro) showed up when Kassoum was nearly fifty, though he looked no older than thirty at the time.

Rumors abound about [Melantha](/codex/characters/melantha-yaro)’s influence on Kassoum, at least among the older people in town, but what is accepted fact is that after a couple of years Kassoum announced that he and [Melantha](/codex/characters/melantha-yaro) were going to be married. Shortly thereafter, they revealed that they were both vampires. They announced it openly, and revealed that they had long had an arrangement with a local butcher to provide them with fresh cow blood.

The couple ran [the Exalted Forest](/codex/regions/the-exalted-forest) alongside Kassoum’s father for nearly twenty years. During that time the less reputable shops in [Dark End](/codex/regions/dark-end) mysteriously shut down. Similarly, the prolific bandit raids along the well-established trade routes through the [Arajaale Tropics](/codex/regions/arajaale-tropics) slowed to a trickle.

In the thirty years since, Kassoum hasn’t aged, while most of the kids he grew up with are grandparents or great grandparents. His grandfather’s shop is thriving, and Kassoum and his wife are pillars of the community.

Kassoum and [Melantha Yaro](/codex/characters/melantha-yaro) met and Kassoum almost instantly figured out that Melantha was a vampire. She had tried to entrance him, but a magical item prevented her vampiric powers from taking effect. Over the couple of years they spent together, Kassoum fell in love with [Melantha](/codex/characters/melantha-yaro), and his charm and business savvy won her over in turn.

Only days before they planned to get married, Kassoum accepted the vampiric curse from his soon-to-be-wife. In the decades since, Kassoum has only tasted human blood occasionally, and only when sanctioned by the city (usually from criminals condemned to death). He knows that without a great deal more blood he will never rise to [Silver Tier](/codex/tiers-of-awakening), but he’s unconcerned about that. A vampire can live indefinitely, even at [Copper Tier](/codex/tiers-of-awakening), and his shop provides him with all of the comfort and security he wants.
