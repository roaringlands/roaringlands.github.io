Resonance is a Memonek Troubador who tried to embrace the emotion of humor, music, and performance. Unfortunately, as a Memonek, Resonance didn't understand the emotions he was trying to invoke. he failed as a court jester, failed as a bard, and failed as a street performer. 

Fortunately, however, his lack of emotional intelligence didn't keep him from investigating an abandoned caravan that seemed to be transporting low-end musical instruments. Inside a damaged lute, Resonance found a rare and powerful [Awakening Stone](/codex/items/awakening-stone). He used the last of his money paying for the [Rite of Awakening](/codex/the-rite-of-awakening).

In an effort to make enough money to live, Resonance tried his hand at street-corner comedy. His disastrous attempt was salvaged by a chance meeting with [Fellyr](/codex/characters/fellyr) and ["Dead" Tam Steeljaw](/codex/characters/dead-tam-stelljaw). Though they couldn't keep the town from kicking Resonance out of the town, they were able to team up and form an adventuring party that would work together to become stronger and help the world.
