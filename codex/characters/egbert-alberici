Egbert is the flamboyant Bert—the one who insists his hat is enchanted (it isn’t) and that the applause of a crowd is a form of divine magic (it might be). He travels from village to village performing sleight of hand, illusion spells, and overly dramatic retellings of other adventurers' deeds—often exaggerating his own minor role in them.

Charming and theatrical, Egbert wears louder clothes than the rest of his brothers (but otherwise looks exactly the same), and his shows are surprisingly good—when they aren’t interrupted by hecklers, wild animals, or the occasional spell misfire. He is never without his collapsible stage, a bright red cloak, and an endless supply of glitter.
