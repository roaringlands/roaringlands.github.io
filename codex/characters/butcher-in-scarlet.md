Among the countless horrors that stalk the broken roads of the [Roaring Lands](/codex/the-roaring-lands), few inspire dread like the Butcher in Scarlet. Commander of the [Red Boots](/codex/organizations/red-boots) and [Gold Tier](/codex/tiers-of-awakening) adventurer-turned-madman, his name is spoken in hushed tones, if at all, but always with a wary glance toward the horizon. For where he walks, death is not far behind.

Once a rising star among the elite, the Butcher in Scarlet was known by another name. That name is was torn from history in rage. He rose to Gold Tier through fire and blood, mastering magical powers that twisted his body into a thing of relentless violence and his mind into something far worse. While others use their strength to protect or conquer, he uses his to destroy without purpose, to indulge in cruelty without limit. Immensely powerful and gloriously mad, he turned from the adventurer’s society and the great cities, carving out his empire in blood with the [Red Boots](/codex/organizations/red-boots) at his heels.

His appearance is as infamous as his acts: a towering figure draped in blood-drenched red plate, etched with runes of pain and preservation. His helm is an open-faced abomination with his mouth always exposed, teeth always grinning, as though he finds endless joy in slaughter. A massive cleaver-like sword, almost crude in design but enchanted to rip through matter and magic alike, hangs across his back. He calls it Heartdrinker, and it’s said to pulse when near fear.

His aura is suffocating. Even other Gold Tier creatures tread lightly in his presence. After all, his blood-soaked soul has been shaped into something monstrous. His combat style is direct, brutal, and impossibly fast. He has waded into battles alone and walked out laughing, caked in gore, without a scratch.

To see the Butcher in Scarlet is to face the end. Not in glorious battle, but in screaming, helpless ruin. He doesn’t just kill.

He devours hope.
