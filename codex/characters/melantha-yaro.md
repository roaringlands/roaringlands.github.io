Melantha Yaro is a stunning woman of middle height. Her long black hair curls only slightly at the ends and contrasts sharply with her pale face. She is thin, almost gaunt, and looks very nearly like the stereotypical vampire.

She dresses in fine, though practical, clothing and doesn’t put on airs. She is blunt, forceful, and unashamedly ruthless. Her customers and friends like working with her because they know that she will use that ruthlessness on their behalf, though her Silver Tier power and vampiric nature do give pause to anyone familiar with vampire lore.

Not much is known about Melantha Yaro’s history. What the people of [Shadowcrest Vale](/codex/regions/shadowcrest-vale) do know is that she showed up some sixty years ago and almost immediately became attached to [Kassoum Yaro](/codex/characters/kassoum-yaro), the next inheritor of [The Exalted Forest](/codex/regions/the-exalted-forest). Their courtship lasted only a few years, before they announced they would be married. Shortly thereafter they announced that they were both vampires who intended to live peacefully in the community.

If it had just been Melantha, the people of [Market Town](/codex/regions/market-town) might not have trusted her, but with Kassoum by her side, a boy and man they had come to know and love, they were prepared to give her the benefit of the doubt.

In the nearly sixty years since, the good people of [Shadowcrest Vale](/codex/regions/shadowcrest-vale) have been given no reason to fear her or her husband. They have served the community and are some of the most well-respected citizens and shopowners in [The Arcane Exchange](/codex/regions/the-arcane-exchange).

Melantha is centuries old. There are horror stories told of her exploits to this day across many different lands, though none are under that name. For much of her youth she rampaged across the world, destroying [Awakened](/codex/the-awakened), drinking blood by the gallon, and turning her enemies into thralls.

It was only after coming to [Shadowcrest Vale](/codex/regions/shadowcrest-vale) in an attempt to hide from some of her more persistent hunters that Melantha’s course changed. She initially intended to charm the man she would eventually marry, take anything of value she could carry away, and then leave him a drained husk.

Her mystical powers failed to work on him, but his natural charm wasn’t so inefficient in the other direction. He convinced Melantha that there was a better way to live. She could have all of the wealth and comfort she craved through mercantile endeavors. Being a vampire openly would prevent her from having to flee or worry about someone finding out. Instead, she could be “one of the good ones.”

There were downsides, of course, she wouldn’t grow in power and further, and animal blood tasted like bitter iron filings and mud. Even so, avoiding the everyday risk of death at the hand of a vengeful hunter, or having to look over your shoulder for the last vampire you betrayed was worth the tradeoff.

Melantha fell in love with [Kassoum](/codex/characters/kassoum-yaro) and offered to turn him into a vampire, a curse which he gladly accepted. Together they endeared themselves to the community.

Secretly, Melantha ensured that their less-reputable competition met with “accidents” or were otherwise brought under thumb. None of this activity was hidden from her husband, but it was also not done in any way that could reasonably lead back to the Yaros. Soon the bandit raids on caravans carrying magical items were forcefully exsanguinated.

In the years since, Melantha has always managed security and espionage for [The Exalted Forest](/codex/regions/the-exalted-forest), and she is very good at it.
