<span class="breadcrumbs" markdown="1">... [Codex](/codex) / Murray</span>

Murray is a mob boss who runs his slice of Shadowcrest Vale from the Shadowed Tavern, a smoky hideout as much a command post as a drinking hole. Though far from the only power in the Vale, Murray has carved out his turf with a mix of charm, coin, and calculated menace. His rackets include smuggling runs through the Vale’s twisting passes, backroom gambling, and a protection network that keeps him flush while keeping rivals guessing.

He knows better than to overplay his hand—several other bosses circle the same streets, and the balance of power shifts with every deal struck or blade drawn in the dark. Murray survives by playing one side against another, smiling while he sharpens the knife behind the bar.
