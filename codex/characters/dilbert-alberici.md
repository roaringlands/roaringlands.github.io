Dilbert Alberici—yes, another Bert—works the shadier corners of Dark End, far from the polished halls and cobbled streets his brothers favor. Despite the grime and the blood, he’s just as cheerful as the rest of the Albericis… only with a glint in his eye that says he’s sizing up your coin purse before you finish your drink.

Dilbert runs the books for a semi-legal fighting ring, where adventurers, brawlers, and the magically reckless test their mettle for coin and glory. He’s quick with odds, quicker with payouts (most of the time), and even quicker to vanish when a bet goes bad. While he shares his brothers’ smile and round build, his coat’s always a little too stained, his pockets a little too heavy, and his friends a little too quiet.

Ask around, and people will tell you: Dilbert's a rascal, a schemer, and definitely not to be trusted—but he’s never boring, and he always remembers your name. Just don’t bet more than you’re willing to lose.
