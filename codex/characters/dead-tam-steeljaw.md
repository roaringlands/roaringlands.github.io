"Dead" Tam Steeljaw is a Revenant Tactician, and one-time elite solider of the [Red Boots](/codex/organizations/red-boots). As a young man, Tam joined up with a mercenary company along with his best friend. Neither really knew the reputation or disposition of the mercenaries, but soon learned that the [Red Boots Mercenaries](/codex/organizations/red-boots) were among the most brutal and unforgiving mercenary organizations in the world.

Tam thrived in the brutal organization, fighting through debilitating injuries and slaying foes with ruthless efficiency. His actions impressed the leadership of the [Red Boots](/codex/organizations/red-boots) enough that he was inducted into their leadership by receiving the [Rite of Awakening](/codex/the-rite-of-awakening). The power of the ritual and his magical [Awakening](/codex/the-awakened) restored his body, replacing his missing mandible with one made of steel, and his missing arm with one made of magical stone.

Unfortunately, Tam's friend couldn't handle the depravity of the [Red Boots](/codex/organizations/red-boots). He attempted to flee and was brutally tortured and executed for his desertion. Though Tam loved life as a mercenary, their betrayal of his best friend made them his enemies. He attempted to take on the leaders of the company, and instead of killing him outright, they staked him out to starve and be eaten by Rabid.

Tam died.

But his rage and desire for revenge would not allow him to remain dead. He returned as a Revenant, intent on hunting down and dismantling the [Red Boots](/codex/organizations/red-boots), and becoming someone his friend could be proud to call a friend. More the former than the latter, but they're both motivations.

Eventually Tam was found by [Fellyr](/codex/characters/fellyr) and freed from his bonds. The two of them have stuck together since, forming something of a strange friendship.
