Vaneiros Oakenpetal is a massively tall firbolg with long, curly brown hair and a muscular build. He almost always bears a smirk on his broad face.

Vaneiros is muscular and bears the telltale perfect features of a powerful Awakened. He can be found behind the bar, or maintaining his inn, [The Towering Gardens](/codex/regions/the-towering-gardens).

Vaneiros is welcoming and friendly to all of his paying patrons. For those who default on their bills, or who cause trouble in his inn, Vaneiros is considerably scarier.

As one of the few Silver Tier [Awakened](/codex/the-awakened) in Shadowcrest Vale Vaneiros is uniquely suited to dealing with trouble.

He favors dry humor and a wry wit.
