Kaela Frostheart favors her human side in many ways, despite the green hued skin and tusks which protrude from her lower jaw. She is attractive and fit, and she normally wears a combination of heavy fabrics and light leathers.

Kaela is unashamed to love living. She has a hedonistic view of life, and savors every moment of it. She is unashamed of anything, and is the most outgoing of her party.

Kaela Frostheart willingly jumps headfirst into almost any vice, but somehow never allows any of them to take permanent hold. Instead she simply enjoys them while they last and then moves on to the next.
