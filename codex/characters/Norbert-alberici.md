Norbert works the docks and gates of Shadowcrest Vale as a mid-ranking customs official, where his unshakable cheerfulness somehow survives beneath layers of paperwork, bribes he always refuses, and endless arguments with caravan masters. He’s the kind of civil servant who actually reads the import permits.

Meticulous, mildly nearsighted, and always armed with a clipboard, Norbert has an uncanny ability to detect forged documents and hidden compartments—though he insists it’s just "intuition and good training." While his brothers call him the boring Bert, Norbert swears he's uncovered at least two smuggling rings and one very confused mimic posing as a crate of oranges.
