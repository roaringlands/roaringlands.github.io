![Rhannon Stormcaller](/assets/img/characters/rhannon-stormcaller.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Rhannon is short, blonde, and slender for her ancestry. She is often happy, but tends to fade into the background.

She most often wears a protective leather top and cloth skirt with wrist-wraps and holsters for her signature handaxes.

Rhannon is painfully shy. She loves to join in the fun with her friends and allies, but doesn’t ever put herself forward as a decision-maker.

Rhannon’s demure nature is even evident on the battlefield. Her rage is not an out-of-control bloodlust. Instead, she always tries to keep an eye on what her team needs, placing herself where her durability and hard-hitting attacks can do the most to help others.
