Hubert Alberici—also known (of course) as Bert—is one of the many indistinguishable Alberici brothers, sharing the same round build, receding hairline, and ever-cheerful demeanor that defines the family. What sets this Bert apart is his sizzling street-food stall in Green Well, where he serves up some of the city's most beloved jungle-inspired fare.

An enthusiastic and talented cook, Hubert has a flair for bold flavors and big portions. Whether he's frying up spiced root fritters, skewering flame-grilled river eel, or ladling out his signature smoky jackfruit stew, Bert’s stall is always surrounded by a crowd of hungry locals and off-duty adventurers.

No one can tell the Alberici brothers apart—but when someone says “Bert, the food Bert,” everyone knows exactly who they mean.
