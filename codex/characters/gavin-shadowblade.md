Gavin Shadowblade is dour, imposing, and serious. His long face rarely turns up in a smile, and he maintains his expensive clothing with the same fastidious care with which he maintains his hair, beard, nails, and equipment.

Gavin looks exactly how he is. He is stoic and serious. He never uses two words when one would do, and doesn’t use one when a significant glance would work.

He is incredibly talented both with magic and with music. Few can match his flawless baritone, nor his effortlessly perfect technique on a wide variety of instruments.

Gavin’s only vice is for cheap beer.
