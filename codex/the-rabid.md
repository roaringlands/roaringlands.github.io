<span class="breadcrumbs" markdown="1">... [Codex](/codex) / The Rabid</span>

The Rabid are creatures made almost entirely of pure magical energy. They come in every possible shape and size, and exist across all [magical tiers](/codex/tiers-of-awakening). Despite their wide variance, the Rabid universally share several features:

- All Rabid seek to kill and destroy people when they find them.
- Rabid have monotone skin, hair, carapace, etc. Each Rabid's exterior shifts from stark white in sunlight, through various gradations of grey, to pitch black in darkness.
- Rabid do not negotiate or interact in any peaceful way with the civilized peoples of the world. They do not seem to communicate in any systematic way. Even so, there have been massive waves of simultaneous attacks that appear to be coordinated, if only by instinct.

The Rabid were heavily inspired by **RWBY**â€™s Creatures of Grimm
