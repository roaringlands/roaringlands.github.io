title: The Rabid
---

The Rabid a creatures made almost entirely of pure magical energy. They come in every possible shape and size, and exist across all of magical tiers. Despite their wide variance, the Rabid universally share several features

- All Rabid seek to kill and destroy people when they find them
- Rabid are monotone in pigmentation, shifting from stark white in sunlight, through various gradations of grey, to pitch black in darkness. All external skin, hair, carapace, etc share the same color.
- Rabid do not seem to communicate in any systematic way, and do not negotiate or interact in any peaceful way with the civilized peoples of the world. Even so, there have been massive waves of simultaneous attacks that appear to be coordinated, if only by instinct.

The Rabid were heavily inspired by **RWBY**â€™s Creatures of Grimm
