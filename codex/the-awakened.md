title: The Awakened
---

Most people and creatures across the Roaring Lands are made up of a little, teensy-tiny bit of magic. The Awakened, on the other hand, are composed of significantly more magic. For almost all Awakened, this change was the result of a magical ritual called the Rite of Awakening.

These rites, when performed change a creature from a mundane creature with only basic animating magic into one formed of a high order of magic. This additional magical energy changes significant aspects of the Awakenedâ€™s body and mind. It increases all of their physical abilities, enhances their minds, and moves them closer to a state of perfection.

All Awakened, like the Rabid, exist along a spectrum of power which determines just how powerful they are, and how much of their being is composed of magic.

The Awakened, Rite of Awakening, and more were all inspired heavily by **He Who Fights with Monsters**.
