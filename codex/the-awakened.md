<span class="breadcrumbs" markdown="1">... [Codex](/codex) / The Awakened</span>

Most people and creatures across the [Roaring Lands](/codex/the-roaring-lands) are made up of a little, teensy-tiny bit of magic. The Awakened, on the other hand, are composed of significantly more magic. For almost all Awakened, this change was the result of a magical ritual called the [Rite of Awakening](/codex/the-rite-of-awakening).

This rite, when performed, changes a creature from a mundane creature with almost no innate magic into creatures whose bodies are formed almost entirely of magic. This additional magical energy changes the Awakenedâ€™s body and mind. It increases all of their physical abilities, enhances their mind, and moves them closer to a state of perfection.

All Awakened, like the [Rabid](/codex/the-rabid), exist along a [spectrum of power](/codex/tiers-of-awakening) which describes how powerful they are, and how much of their being is composed of magic.

The Awakened, [Rite of Awakening](/codex/the-rite-of-awakening), and more were all inspired heavily by **He Who Fights with Monsters**.
