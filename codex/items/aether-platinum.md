This disc of crystallized magic acts as currency. Spending one of these when making a purchase can raise your Wealth to 5, for this purchase only, if your current Wealth is less than 5.

In addition to its use as currency, Aether can be consumed for a burst of additional power. A creature of a lower Tier than that of this item can consume this Aether to gain a number of surges each turn for 2 turns. These surges must be used on the turn in which they are gained. However, for a short time after consuming any Aether, using another magical consumable deals damage to the user, which cannot be reduced or avoided. The user cannot be killed by this damage. If you would be, reduce your Stamina to only one point above death. All effects of consuming Aether, including the number of Surges granted, duration of cooldown period, and damage dealt to the user, are based on the difference between the user's tier and that of the Aether being consumed, as shown on the Aether Effects Table below.

If you are of Platinum Tier, consuming this Aether has no effect.
