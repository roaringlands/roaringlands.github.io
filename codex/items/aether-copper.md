This disc of crystallized magic acts as currency, having one of these can temporarily raise your Wealth to 2, if your base Wealth is less than 2.

A creature lower than Copper Tier can eat this item to gain 3x tier difference surges each turn for 12 seconds. For the following 1x Rank Difference hours, using any magical consumable deals 1d10+1 Copper damage, which cannot be reduced or avoided, and cannot kill the creature. The consumable has no other effect.
