This disc of crystallized magic acts as currency, having one of these can temporarily raise your Wealth to 3, if your base Wealth is less than 3.

A creature lower than Silver Tier can eat this item to gain a number of surges equal to 3x tier difference each turn for 12 seconds. For the following 1x Rank Difference hours, using any magical consumable deals (1d10+2) x Tier Difference damage, which cannot be reduced or avoided, and cannot kill the creature. The consumable has no other effect.
