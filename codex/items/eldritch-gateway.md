Eldritch Gateways, revered marvels of arcane engineering, are mystical teleportation devices meticulously crafted to traverse the vast expanses of the realms within a predetermined network. These gateways serve as conduits between designated nodes, allowing the swift transport of individuals and objects across great distances with unparalleled efficiency.

Access to an Eldritch Gateway is governed by intricate passcodes, serving as the key to unlock their boundless potential. For those who seek to utilize these gateways, the acquisition of the correct passcode is paramount. Gateways are available for both rental and purchase, catering to the diverse needs of travelers and organizations alike.

In the case of rentals, the custodians of the Eldritch Gateway network maintain strict control over the distribution and management of passcodes, ensuring the security and integrity of the interconnected nodes. However, for those who possess the means and desire for autonomy, the option to purchase an Eldritch Gateway affords them the privilege of sovereignty over their passage.

Owners of these magnificent devices hold the power to alter their passcodes at will, allowing them to regulate access and safeguard their investments. Whether rented or owned, Eldritch Gateways stand as indispensable tools for expedited travel and the facilitation of commerce and communication across the realms.
