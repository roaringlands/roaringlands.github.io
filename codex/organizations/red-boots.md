Wherever a tyrannical monarch rules and seeks the destruction of an enemy, the Red Boots march. And wherever the Red Boots go, terror follows. Clothed in bcrimson leathers and wielding weapons stained with decades of cruelty, this brutal mercenary band is not driven by honor, ideology, or loyalty. They serve only coin, chaos, and the thrill of watching the world burn.

Their name isn’t just a symbol—it’s a promise. The Red Boots were so christened by their founder with one grim vow: that in every battle, they would wade in blood up to their knees. It is not armor that stains their boots crimson, but the lives they trample beneath them.

No village is too small, no target too innocent. Where they ride, they leave scorched fields, butchered innocents, and silence—thick, dreadful silence. Survivors, if any remain, tell stories of laughter in the slaughter and boots squelching through blood-soaked earth.

Led by the infamous [Butcher in Scarlet](/codex/characters/butcher-in-scarlet), the Red Boots don’t take prisoners, they leave warnings. Their emblem, a single bloodied footprint, is often the last thing seen before fire consumes the horizon. They are more than soldiers—they are nightmares wrapped in flesh and iron, and they do not march for victory.

They march for carnage.
