The Rite of Awakening is a magical ritual any character can perform, assuming they meet the following requirements:

1. They must have an [Awakening Stone](/codex/items/awakening-stone) of the correct tier and Level.
1. They must know the ritual
1. They must have learned the necessary lessons from their current Tier and Level to enable advancement.

In the [Roaring Lands](/codex/the-roaring-lands), the Rite of Awakening is a powerful arcane ritual designed to unlock or enhance the innate magical potential within a creature. The ritual revolves around the central component known as an [Awakening Stone](/codex/items/awakening-stone), a stone disc composed of ancient magical energies. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the components, steps, incantations, and other elements involved in the Rite of Awakening:

1. **Preparation:** Before the ritual can commence, the ritual space must be prepared. Most often, the Rite of Awakening is performed within a specially prepared ritual room. Such a room, though often preferred, is not required. Preparing the ritual space involves inscribing intricate runes and symbols on the ground in a circular pattern, creating an arcane space for the ritual to take place. Candles are lit at each cardinal point to represent the elements, and incense is burned to equalize the natural magic within the ritual space.
1. **Gathering of Components:** The [Awakening Stone](/codex/items/awakening-stone), the primary component of the ritual, is placed at the center of the circle, held by the subject of the ritual. Surrounding the subject small stacks of Aether are arranged corresponding to the next Tier of Awakening. These Aether focus and enhance the magical power of the ritual.
1. **Invocation of Powers:** The ritual begins with the Incantor (a trained ritual magician) invoking the powers of the arcane. They recite ancient incantations, calling upon magical forces and the unseen realms to lend their strength to the ritual.
1. **Communion with the Divine (Optional):** If the subject undergoing the Rite of Awakening is seeking connection with a specific entity or god, symbols and prayers relevant to the desired entity may be incorporated into the ritual. This serves to establish a spiritual connection between the subject and their deity or patron, further empowering the awakening process.
1. **Sacrificial Offering:** In some cases, a symbolic sacrifice may be required to complete the ritual. This could involve the burning of sacred incense, the offering of rare jewels, or even the shedding of blood. The exact nature of the offering is highly dependent upon the types and rank of power being sought by the subject of the ritual.
1. **Empowerment of the Creature:** With the culmination of the ritual nearing, the [Awakening Stone](/codex/items/awakening-stone) begins to glow with a brilliant, ethereal light. The Incantor utters the final incantations, commanding the stone to release its potent energies and infuse the subject with newfound magical power.
1. **Transformation and Awakening:** As the energies surge through the subject’s body, they undergo a profound transformation. Their senses become heightened, their magical abilities awaken to new heights, and they emerge from the ritual chamber as an Awakened being of greater power, radiating with an unmistakable aura of power.
1. **Purging of Impurities:** Following the rite, the subject forcefully expels the impurities of their former bodies. This is a decidedly unpleasant experience and often requires multiple uses of cleaning magic to cleanse the foul substances excreted during the process.

The Rite of Awakening is a potent ritual. Successful completion of the ritual heralds the birth of a powerful new entity, whether ally or enemy.
