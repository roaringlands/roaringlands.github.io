<span class="breadcrumbs" markdown="1">... [Codex](/codex) / Tiers of Awakening</span>

All creatures, and even objects, exist along a spectrum of magical power. Scholars across the [Roaring Lands](/codex/the-roaring-lands) have broken up the spectrum into several meaningful categories. These categories allow people to talk about the relative power of [Awakened](/codex/the-awakened) and [Rabid](/codex/the-rabid) within a shared context.

There are five Tiers of Awakening:

- **Normal:** Normal creatures have only the basic physical prowess granted to them by birth. Everything in our world, from the weakest field mouse, to the most impressive Olympic athlete exists at this level.
- **Copper:** The Copper Tier represents the first real Tier of Awakening. Copper Tier creatures age slowly, and recover from injury or sickness with supernatural speed. Even the most powerful Normal Tier creature would lose in a fight against almost all Copper Tier creatures.
    - Copper Tier characters are those from levels 1 to 3.
- **Silver:** The Silver Tier represents incredible power. Creatures who have reached Silver Tier have incredible power. They age even more slowly and are entirely immune to sickness. Even losing a limb is only a temporary setback for a Silver Tier creature.
    - Silver Tier characters are those from levels 4 to 6.
- **Gold:** The Gold Tier represents a level of power similar to a demigod. Gold Tier creatures cannot die of old age, and even being beheaded is not enough to kill them. There are few threats in the world that can touch a Gold Tier creture.
    -Gold Tier characters are those from levels 7 to 9.
- **Platinum:** The Platinum Tier represents the height of power a mortal can reach. While Platinum Tier creatures can be killed, it is exceedingly difficult. Creatures at this level are mere steps away from godhood themselves. Only fools challenge a creature of this level. 
    -Platinum Tier characters are those at level 10 and above.
