title: Tiers of Awakening
---

All creatures, and even objects exist along a spectrum of magical power. Scholars across the world have broken up the spectrum into several meaningful categories. These categories allow people to talk about the relative power of [Awakened](/codex/the-awakened) and [Rabid](/codex/the-rabid) with shared context.

There are five Tiers of Awakening:

- **Normal:** Normal creatures have only the basic physical, magical, or other prowess granted to them by birth. Everything in our world, from the weakest field mouse, to the most impressive Olympic athlete exists at this level.
- **Copper:** The copper tier represents the first real Tier of Awakening. Even the weakest creature at this level would win any given contest as often as they would lose against the most powerful and impressive normal tier creature. Copper Tier characters are those from levels 1 to 3.
- **Silver:** Silver Tier creatures have reached superhuman levels of power and capability. Silver Tier characters are those from levels 4 to 6.
- **Gold:** Gold Tier creatures have reached a level at which they are practically demigods. There are few threats in the world that can touch them. Gold Tier characters are those from levels 7 to 9.
- **Platinum:** Platinum Tier creatures are not just demigods. They are mere steps away from godhood themselves. Only fools challenge a creature of this level. Platinum Tier characters are those at level 10 and above.
