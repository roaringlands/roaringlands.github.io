## Outworlder Traits
Outworlder heroes have access to the following traits.

### Signature Trait: Former Life
Choose the ancestry you were before you were transported through the astral plane. Your size equals that ancestryâ€™s size. Your speed is 5. You lose all other ancestral benefits from your original ancestry.

### Signature Trait: Language Adaptation
You can understand and speak any language. You understand the literal meaning of the words you hear or read, but connotations, idioms, and other symbolic language does not translate. Similarly, any idioms you use will be literally translated into the destination language.

### Purchased Outworlder Traits
You have 3 ancestry points to spend on the following traits:

#### Previous Life (Costs 1 Point)
You gain a purchasable trait that costs 1 ancestry point from your previous ancestry. You can take this trait multiple times, selecting a new cost 1 trait from your previous ancestry each time you take this trait.

#### Map (Costs 1 Point)
You have a supernatural map of some kind you can summon as a maneuver. This map contains rough outlines of areas you haven't visited, including other parts of the world. As you explore the world, your map becomes more detailed. You can view your map at any level of detail, though the information on your map is limited to geographic features or annotations you make yourself.

Your Director does not have to provide an actual map for you, though they may do so. Functionally, as long as you have this power available, you cannot become lost.

#### Team Chat (Costs 1 Point)
You can communicate telepathically with any member of your adventuring party at will, as long as they are within 1 mile of you. Team members may speak with you or other members of your team as if they had this power. All of this communication is telepathic and does not require vocalization.

#### Extradimensional Storage Space (Costs 1 Point)
As a maneuver you may reach into an extradimensional space and either stow or retrieve any item you can lift. This storage is not accessible to anyone else, unless they have a looting power.

#### Spirit Bond (Costs 1 Point)
A a maneuver you can give an ally a skill you posess for the next test they make. After completing that test, regardless of the outcome, they lose access to this skill. Alternatively, you can choose to gain any one skill an ally posesses for the next test you make. After completing that test, regardless of the outcome, you lose access to that skill.

#### Tracking Immunity (Costs 1 Point)
You are immune to being tracked by supernatural (or technological) effects, including the human ability **Detect the Supernatural**. This protection does not necessarily apply to equipment or abilities you use which are not related directly to your Outworlder Ancestry.
