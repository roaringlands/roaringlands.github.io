## Outworlder Traits
Outworlder heroes have access to the following traits.

### Signature Trait: Language Adaptation
You can understand and speak any language. You understand the literal meaning of the words you hear or read, but connotations, idioms, and other symbolic language does not translate. Similarly, any idioms you use will be literally translated into the destination language.

### Purchased Outworlder Traits
You have 3 ancestry points to spend on the following traits:

#### Map (Costs 1 Point)
You have a supernatural map of some kind you can summon as a maneuver. This map contains rough outlines of areas you haven't visited, including other parts of the world. As you explore the world, your map becomes more detailed. You can view your map at any level of detail, though the information on your map is limited to geographic features or annotations you make yourself.

{: box-note}
Your Director does not have to provide an actual map for you, though they may do so. Functionally, as long as you have this power available, you cannot become lost.

#### Team Chat (Costs 1 Point)
You can communicate telepathically with any member of your adventuring party at will, as long as they are within 1 mile of you. Team members may speak with you or other members of your team as if they had this power. All of this communication is telepathic and does not require vocalization.

#### Extradimensional Storage Space (Costs 1 Point)
As a maneuver you may reach into an extradimensional space and either stow or retrieve any item you can lift. This storage is not accessible to anyone else, unless they have a looting power.

#### Loot (Costs 2 Points)
You gain the following ability:
