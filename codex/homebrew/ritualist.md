{: .box-note}
This is a minor modification to the Ritualist Perk from *DRAW STEEL*.

You gain the knowledge and ability to perform a wide range of ritual magic.

Additionally, you can spend 1 minute performing a magic ritual of blessing. At the end of the ritual, touch one willing creature, including yourself. The creature gains a double edge on the next test they make within the next minute. A creature canâ€™t use this benefit on an activity that takes longer than a minute.
