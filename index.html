<div class="box-warning"><b>Important:</b> Session Zero is scheduled for Saturday, April 12, 2025 at 1pm.</div>

<p>Welcome to the <a href="/codex/roaring-lands">Roaring Lands</a>, where Bands take up arms to protect civilization and earn fabulous wealth and glory while doing so. In this <i>DRAW STEEL</i> campaign, players will emerge from obscurity to take on incredible power, form a mercenary band, and perhaps even rise to worldwide acclaim.</p>
<p>Although we’re using <i>DRAW STEEL</i> rules, the <a href="/codex/roaring-lands">Roaring Lands</a> don’t take place on Orden (the default setting for <i>DRAW STEEL</i>). If you have a cool idea about where your character comes from, how the world works, or almost anything else, let me know and we can work together to make it part of the world you can explore. I'm excited to bring your ideas to life!</p>
<p>This simple site contains almost everything you’ll need to know to get started playing in the <a href="/codex/roaring-lands">Roaring Lands</a>. So start thinking about the character you’ll want to create and learn about the <a href="/codex/roaring-lands">Roaring Lands</a>.</p>

<h2 class="section-header codex">The Codex<span class="ai-img"></span></h2>
<p>I've compiled a lot of information about the <a href="/codex/roaring-lands">Roaring Lands</a>, all of which is stored in the <a href="/codex">Codex</a>! Do you want to know about the <a href="/codex/the-rabid">Rabid</a>? How about what in the world <a href="/codex/#items">Aethers</a> could be?</p>
<p>Well then you're in luck. The <a href="/codex">Codex</a> has all of that information and more. If you really want to be prepared for a game in the <a href="/codex/roaring-lands">Roaring Lands</a>, be sure to read up!</p>

<h2 class="section-header schedule">Game Schedule<span class="ai-img"></span></h2>
<div class="box-note">Game sessions will be held on the second and fourth Saturdays of each month from 1pm to 5pm, at my home in Liberty.</div>
<p>I expect players to attend regularly and to arrive on time. That being said, life happens, and we will all understand if you cannot make it one week. Please just let us know as early as possible so I can plan ahead.</p>
<p>We will cancel sessions under only a few conditions:
<ol>
    <li>I am unable to host (including for sickness, events with higher priority, etc)</li>
<li>There will be fewer than 3 players, total.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>In all other cases, though we may not progress our campaign story, we will still get together and do something else. This is time we get to spend with friends doing things we like. Let's make the most of it.</p>
<p>If your schedule or ability to commit changes in the future please let us know as soon as possible, and we will work together to allow the game to continue. <b>THE GAME MUST GO ON!</b></p>
<p>Finally, if our group decides to handle specific parts of the game, such as respite activities or leveling up, outside of the normally scheduled game session, each player is expected to complete these activities before the next session or lose all benefits that they would have gained.</p>
<p>In other words, be a grown-up about it. If you need help, just ask.</p>

<h3>But I've Never Heard of <i>DRAW STEEL</i></h2>
<p>That's okay! Most of us haven't played it either. In fact, it's not even been published yet. We'll be using the playtest rules. Since everyone's new to <i>DRAW STEEL</i> you don't need to worry about being new. We'll all learn together.</p>
