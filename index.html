<p>Welcome to the Roaring Lands, where Bands take up arms to protect civilization and earn fabulous wealth and glory while doing so. In this <i>DRAW STEEL</i> campaign, players will emerge from obscurity to take on incredible power, form a mercenary band, and perhaps even rise to worldwide acclaim.</p>

<p>Although we’re using <i>DRAW STEEL</i> rules, the Roaring Lands don’t take place on Orden. If you want a homebrewed race or ability, we can work together to make that happen!</p>

<p>I’m willing and excited to bring elements from your backstories to life. If you have a cool idea about where your character comes from, how the world works, or almost anything else, let me know and we can work together to make it part of the world you can explore.</p>

<p>This simple site contains much of the starting information you’ll need to get started thinking about the character you’ll want to create and learn the information you need to know about the Roaring Lands.</p>
