<p>Welcome to the <a href="/codex/roaring-lands">Roaring Lands</a>, where Bands take up arms to protect civilization and earn fabulous wealth and glory while doing so. In this <i>DRAW STEEL</i> campaign, players will emerge from obscurity to take on incredible power, form a mercenary band, and perhaps even rise to worldwide acclaim.</p>
<p>Although we’re using <i>DRAW STEEL</i> rules, the <a href="/codex/roaring-lands">Roaring Lands</a> don’t take place on Orden (the default setting for <i>DRAW STEEL</i>). If you have a cool idea about where your character comes from, how the world works, or almost anything else, let me know and we can work together to make it part of the world you can explore. I'm excited to bring your ideas to life!</p>

<h3>But I've Never Heard of <i>DRAW STEEL</i>!</h2>
<p>That's okay! Most of us haven't played it either. In fact, it's not even been published yet. We'll be using the playtest rules. Since everyone's new to <i>DRAW STEEL</i> you don't need to worry about being new. We'll all learn together.</p>
